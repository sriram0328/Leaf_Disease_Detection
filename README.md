# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection  


## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Leaf Disease Detection System** that uses deep learning to classify plant leaf diseases. The model identifies different types of diseases from images and helps in early disease diagnosis for better crop management.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📷 **Upload Leaf Images** for disease detection  
- 🔍 **Real-time Predictions** using a deep learning model  
- 📊 **User-friendly Interface** powered by **Streamlit**  
- 📌 **Accurate Disease Classification** with a trained model  
- 🌱 **Helps Farmers & Researchers** with plant health analysis  

## 📂 Dataset  
The model is trained on a dataset containing **healthy and diseased leaf images**. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to improve accuracy.  

## 🏗️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Yolov8** 🤖  
- **OpenCV** 📷  
- **NumPy & Pandas** 📊  
- **Streamlit** 🌐 (for deployment)  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
